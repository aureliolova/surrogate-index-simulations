# Surrogate Index Talk Notes
* Author: Aurelio López-Malo Vázquez de Lara

## Objective of the talk
1. Present the Surrogate Index Model (SIM) as a method for estimating long-term effects using short-term data.
    1. Most importantly, lay out the assumptions of the method.
2. Using simulations, assess the consequences of the results of using a SIM if the assumptions are not met.
3. Present some real use-cases at Glovo.
